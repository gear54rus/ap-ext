## AP-EXT, the annoying popups extension

### How to build

You need to have `node`, `yarn` and `zip` to build this. Inside the folder, run:

```bash
yarn
yarn build
# to start dev build and watch file changes
# yarn dev
./scripts/build.sh
```

Now you have `AP-EXT.zip` (Chrome) and `AP-EXT.xpi` (Firefox).
